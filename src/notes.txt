## Potential Improvements

## Potential Improvements

- **Error Handling:** instead of using `alert()`.
- **Modularity:** Further modularizing the code into smaller, more focused modules.
- **Accessibility:** Review the HTML and CSS to ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., using semantic HTML, providing proper ARIA attributes, and ensuring sufficient color contrast).
- **Performance:** Optimize performance by minimizing DOM manipulations, using efficient algorithms, and potentially implementing techniques like virtual DOM (if using a framework like React in the future).
